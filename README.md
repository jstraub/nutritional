Nutritional is a collection of scripts to interact with the [USDA
nutrition database]() 

-  

The USDA DB parser was inspired by the following projects:
[nutrient-db](https://github.com/schirinos/nutrient-db),
[django-usda](https://github.com/notanumber/django-usda) and
[nutritionparser](https://github.com/lnielsen/nutritionparser).
